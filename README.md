C clears and sets everything to zero. <br/>

If you press the "." button without giving a number beforehand , you will automatically get a zero before "." happens. <br/>
If you press a number and you have a result already, you will clear the result and set the displaytext to the new number.  <br/>
If you press a operator and you have a result already, you will use the result for your next operation.  <br/>
If you press the equals button and there is a result already, nothing will happen.
